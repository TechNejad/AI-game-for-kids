# “Generate...Summarize...Create”: Why do your AI-assistants behave the way they do?

This is an active project for the Interdisciplinary Project course, being developed by Mohsen Hassan Nejad, Jacob Solaña, Isabella Anderson, and Luke Schumacher.

Our goal is to create an interactive platform that helps users understand how AI models behave the way they do: by unmasking the hidden system prompts and behavior patterns embedded in different AI agents and characters.
