# Unmasking a Chatbot: Whoâ€™s Really Talking?

This project is a simple web-based demonstration designed to illustrate how different underlying "personas" or "system prompts" can dramatically alter a chatbot's responses, even when given the same initial query. It highlights the hidden instructions that shape AI behavior.

## Features

*   **Interactive Prompt Selection:** Choose from predefined questions or enter your own.
*   **Persona-Based Responses:** See how the same question is answered by a "Wise mentor," a "Persuasive assistant," and a "Neutral assistant."
*   **Layered Instruction Explanation:** Uncover the conceptual layers of instructions (user, platform, foundational prompts) that influence a chatbot's output.
*   **Visually Engaging:** A clean, space-themed interface enhances the user experience.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
