# Unmasking a Chatbot: Whoâ€™s Really Talking?

This project is a simple web-based demonstration designed to illustrate how different underlying "personas" or "system prompts" can dramatically alter a chatbot's responses, even when given the same initial query. It highlights the hidden instructions that shape AI behavior.

It is a work in progress! Please do not attempt to copy it; you can always collaborate with me on it.
